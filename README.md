| [TodoMVC](https://todomvc.com/) | A project that showcases the same todo application built across a range of JavaScript frameworks |
| [ToDesktop Builder](https://www.todesktop.com/) | An application for creating cross-platform desktop apps with a few lines of code   |



## Outcome

After following the [guide](https://todesktop1.notion.site/How-to-Build-a-Multi-Window-TodoMVC-Desktop-App-with-ToDesktop-Builder-cb5cb32e68d34a909c00d15a470dd906), you will have a fully functional todo app that is capable of the following:
